# RadCam Manager

It provides a Vue3 application to be loaded either as a BlueOS extension, and as an iframe for Cockpit.

The project has a backend with basically three services:

1. A [Mavlink Camera Manager](http://github.com/mavlink/mavlink-camera-manager) client, responsible to authenticate and setup RadCam streams.
2. A web server, responsible to serve the frontend as a static websitem as well as providing a REST API for it.
3. A RadCam protocol proxy, translating requests from the frontend to the camera itself.

## How to run

There are a few options:

### As a BlueOS extension:

1. Find the RadCam Manager on the Extensions Store, and install it.
2. A "RadCam" should appear on the left menu after a few seconds.
3. Click the "RadCam" menu item to access the application's interface.
4. Open Cockpit, there should be an available configured iframe

- Extension Identifier: `bluerobotics.radcam_manager`
