# 4K Cam Manager

It provides a Vue3 application to be loaded either as a BlueOS extension, and as an iframe for Cockpit.

The project has a backend with basically three services:

1. A [Mavlink Camera Manager](http://github.com/mavlink/mavlink-camera-manager) client, responsible to authenticate and setup 4K Cam streams.
2. A web server, responsible to serve the frontend as a static websitem as well as providing a REST API for it.
3. A 4K Cam protocol proxy, translating requests from the frontend to the camera itself.

## How to run

There are a few options:

### As a BlueOS extension:

1. Find the 4K Cam Manager on the Extensions Store, and install it.
2. A "4K Cam" should appear on the left menu after a few seconds.
3. Click the "4K Cam" menu item to access the application's interface.
4. Open Cockpit, there should be an available configured iframe

### As a BlueOS extension, manually:

- Extension Identifier: `bluerobotics.br4kcam_manager`

- Extension Name: `4K Cam Manager`

- Docker image: `joaoantoniocardoso/br4kcam-manager`

- [Mavlink Camera Manager](http://github.com/mavlink/mavlink-camera-manager) instance running somewhere. It can configurable using the `--mcm-address <MCM_ADDRESS>` command line argument.
- Some MAVLink-compatible autopilot firmware running with version `>=4.7.0`
- Some MAVLink router endpoint, configurable using the `--mavlink` command line argument.
